Protect your images and apply a watermark: leave your distinguishing logo and be sure to always recognize what's yours.

== Description ==

Take advantage of YITH WooCommerce Watermark's features to apply an identifying logo to your images. Customize them, and make them always recognizable as yours. Apply the watermark to more images at the same time, and use the rapid and easy "Reset" button to restore your original images without losing them.
For a more detailed list of options and features of the plugin, please look at the [official documentation](http://yithemes.com/docs-plugins/yith-woocommerce-watermark/ "YITH WooCommerce Watermark")

**Main features:**

* Select your watermark and apply it to all featured images!
* Create a backup of the original images to restore them easily

= Installation =

Once you have installed the plugin, you just need to activate the plugin in order to enable it.

= Configuration =

YITH WooCommerce Watermark will add a new submenu called "Watermark" in "YIT Plugins" menu. From here you can configure all plugin settings.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip the downloaded zip file.
2. Upload the plugin folder into the `wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress site.
3. Activate `YITH WooCommerce Watermark` from Plugins page

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I change the position of the watermark? =
No, in the free version of the plugin the watermark will be showed in the low-right part of the image.

= Which kind of images I can use for watermark? =
You could use any kind of image file, but for the best result, we suggest using PNG files to keep the transparency of the image.

= Will I lose my original images if I install the plugin? =
= After version 1.0.7 =
No, the plugin creates a backup of all your original image in a private directory. To restore your original images (size and format), click on the Reset button of the plugin option, deactivate the plugin and regenerate the thumbnails!
= Before version 1.0.7 =
No, the plugin creates a backup of all your original images, adding "_ywcwat_original_" before the name of your files (e.g., _ywcwat_original_yourfile.jpg). To restore your original images (size and format), click on the Reset button of the plugin option, deactivate the plugin and regenerate the thumbnails!

= Is the plugin compatible with all WordPress themes? =

Compatibility with all themes is impossible, because they are too many, but generally if themes are developed according to WordPress and WooCommerce guidelines, YITH plugins are compatible with them.
Yet, we can grant compatibility with themes developed by YIThemes, because they are constantly updated and tested with our plugins. Sometimes, especially when new versions are released, it might only require some time for them to be all updated, but you can be sure that they will be tested and will be working in a few days.

= How can I get support if my WooCommerce plugin is not working? =

If you have problems with our plugins or something is not working as it should, first follow this preliminary steps:

* Test the plugin with a WordPress default theme, to be sure that the error is not caused by the theme you are currently using.
* Deactivate all plugins you are using and check if the problem is still occurring.
* Ensure that you plugin version, your theme version and your WordPress and WooCommerce version (if required) are updated and that the problem you are experiencing has not already been solved in a later plugin update.

If none of the previous listed actions helps you solve the problem, then, submit a ticket in the forum and describe your problem accurately, specify WordPress and WooCommerce versions you are using and any other information that might help us solve your problem as quickly as possible. Thanks!
